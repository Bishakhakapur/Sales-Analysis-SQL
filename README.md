## üß© SQL Analysis

The project includes a set of SQL scripts implementing key queries:

1. **Total Orders & Revenue**
    ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue 
    FROM orders;
    ```

2. **Top 5 Selling Pizzas**
    ```sql
    SELECT p.name, SUM(o.quantity) AS sold_qty
    FROM orders o
    JOIN pizzas p ON o.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY sold_qty DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

3. **Sales Distribution by Hour**
4. **Revenue Contribution by Pizza Category**
5. **Top Revenue Pizza Each Month**
6. **Revenue Share by Pizza Size**
7. *(Add more queries if applicable‚Ä¶)*
